            commitment. It not only requires years of practice but also passion and dedication. Originally played in
            Britain, this sport has spread worldwide and made a remarkable impact on the lives of people.

            Professionally, a cricket match consists of two competing teams with their playing eleven. The matches are
            set in a stadium filled with crowd, commentators, umpires and cameras for their live telecast. There are
            different formats and championships for the game including:

            Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and T20 Internationals which are unlimited, 50 and 20 over
            matches respectively
            There are many teams from across the continents representing their own country
            Distinguished cricket tournaments include the World Cup played after every 4 years in both 20 and 50 over
            formats, the Ashes played between the cricket teams of England and Australia, Tri-series played by three
            nations and the Asia Cup played between India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
            Besides this, every country separately organizes its own premier leagues of 20 overs with players from
            different nations.
